Deploying software to a VPC deployment 3!

Description

In this deployment, we have deployed from one VPC to another. We have a default VPC created by AWS. Previously, we created our Jenkins server in the public subnet. Now, we have created another VPC and will deploy our application in the public subnet in the EC2 instance.
